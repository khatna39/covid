# Topic: Covid-19 Maps 

The following two maps show the spread of Covid-19 in the US for the year 2020. The choropleth map shows the rates (number of people with covid / population) of all the counties in the US. The proportional symbols map shows the cases (number of people with covid) of all the counties in the US. From the maps, we can observe that the southern states had most of the cases/rates. The cases map also show that large population centers had bigger amount of occurances of Covid-19.

## Methods
The methods used for this project was very similar to the Japan-earthquake project. The difference was, I had to produce 2 maps from 1 main javascript file. To achieve that, I used conditionals and the window object.
